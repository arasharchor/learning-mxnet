# Learning MXNet
[MXNet](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet) is a deep learning framework. This repository contains examples for Image Classification and Object Detection.

## Install MXNet
First install mxnet by [Guide](http://mxnet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to/build.html)

## Image Classification
We train a convolutional neural network for Image Classification using [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset, which consists of 60000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.

## Object Detection
[Yon only look once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection](http://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) (YOLO) is a new real-time approach to object detection.
